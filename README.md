- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zippy6666
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI, Machine Learning, Python, Programming, Software Development, System Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI/ML and Python

Most of my github project are likely going to be so called "addons" for a game known as "Garry's Mod", all coded in Lua. I am however also very experienced with Python. I do also know a thing or two about database technology, web frameworks, machine learning, as well as some basics for common programming languages.
